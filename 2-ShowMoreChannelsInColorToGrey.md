**Summary**

Allow the display for the ColorToGrey module to show an arbitrary number of channels.  

**Background and rationale**



**Proposal**

One of two solutions would be helpful- ideally we could show every channel as it's split out, as CorrectIlluminationApply can for n-dimensional images.  If for some reason that wasn't possible, simply adding a sentence saying "N more channels not shown".  

**Implementation**

TBC
